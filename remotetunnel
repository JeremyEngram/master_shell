#!/bin/bash

# This script establishes an SSH tunnel that forwards traffic from port 2001 on your local machine 
# to port 80 on a remote host through a secure SSH connection. This is often used to access a remote 
# service securely as if it were running on your local machine.

# The command structure is as follows:
# ssh -f -N -L<local_port>:<remote_host>:<remote_port> <remote_host>

# Breakdown of the ssh command:
# -f : Run in the background after authentication is complete.
# -N : Do not execute any remote commands, only set up port forwarding.
# -L2001:localhost:80 : Forward connections from local port 2001 to remote port 80 on the remote host.

# Define variables for better readability and maintainability
LOCAL_PORT=2001
REMOTE_HOST="remotehost"
REMOTE_PORT=80

# Establish the SSH tunnel
ssh -f -N -L${LOCAL_PORT}:localhost:${REMOTE_PORT} ${REMOTE_HOST}

# After running this script, you can access the remote service by connecting to http://localhost:${LOCAL_PORT}
