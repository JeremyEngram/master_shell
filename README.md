# master_shell
master_shell project 2.0 from initial commit from DynamicDesignz that incorporates much more extensive and   powerful shell scripts to work in conjunction with each other in an unofficial framework of each individual shell script designed to run it's own individual standalone process or function within a Linux system in turn automating some of the most tedious administrative tasks, this includes but is not limited to a working list of aliases, intuitive command symlinks, and fairly basic and easily configurable custom scripts starting with a fully customizable first time install script for extensive new package installs and configurations on setup.
